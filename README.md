# Machine-Learning-Model-Knowledge-based-for-GNR-Interconnects

•In this Project we made various Machine Learning Models for
predicting MFP due to scattering by edge roughness at given
wavelength , predicting MFP due to scattering by edge roughness at
given fermi energy ,predicting the effective MFP of electrons in GNR
at given wavelength ,predicting the effective MFP of electrons in
GNR at given fermi energy , predicting the number of layers in
MLGNR at given thickness, predicting scattering resistance , lumped
resistance and quantum resistance resulting in the prediction of the
total resistance.

Objectives
• Creating a machine learning model to predict the number of layers in GNR at
given thickness.
• Developing a machine learning model to predict MFP due to scattering by edge
roughness at given wavelength

roughness at given fermi energy
• Developing a machine learning model to predict the effective MFP of electrons in
GNR at given wavelength
• Developing a machine learning model to predict the effective MFP of electrons in
GNR at given fermi energy
• Developing a machine learning model to predict scattering resistance,lumped
resistance and quantum resistance resulting in the prediction of the total resistance.

Implementations
Tools used:
We have used a number of programming and machine learning tools for our project. Some of them are:
•Programming Language - Python
•Libraries used:
• numpy for creating arrays and working in them.
• pandas for reading and creating csv files and working on dataframes.
• sklearn for making use of some predefined models like linear regression and polynomial regression.
• matplotlib for plotting various graphs and contours.
• SciPy for extracting the values of several scientific constants used in our project.
•Software for plotting graphs- Origin.
•Platform used for creating models-Jupyter Notebook and Google Collab Notebook.
